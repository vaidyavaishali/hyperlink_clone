                    <p>In 2021, while searching for expert IT and software developers, we encountered a harsh reality. We discovered that many of our beloved fellow students from Vidharbha lagged behind the global talent force in terms of knowledge expertise and mindset. These aspects were identified as critical factors for entering professional jobs and setting a trajectory for forward growth
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recognizing this gap, we understood the importance of addressing the issue and bridging the knowledge and mindset divide among students in VIdharbha. We believed that empowering individuals with the necessary skills and cultivating the right mindset would not only benefit the students but also contribute to the overall development of the region.</p>
